# Homework Lesson 4 - Conditionals

# READ CAREFULLY THE EXERCISE DESCRIPTION AND SOLVE IT RIGHT AFTER IT

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 1: Temperature Classification
# You're developing a weather application. Write a program that takes 
# a temperature in Fahrenheit as input. If the temperature is above 
# 85Â°F, print "Hot day ahead!".

# <Your code here>
temperature = int(input("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: "))
if temperature >= 85:
    print('Hot day ahead')
elif temperature <=0:
    print('It is too cold outside')
elif temperature <85:
    print('Temperature is normal')
else:
    print('What is the temperature? you did not enter the number')

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2: Grade Classifier
# As a teacher, you want to automate grading. Write a program that
# takes a student's score as input and prints "Pass" if the score is
# 50 or above, otherwise print "Fail".
# Do not forget that the input() function returns a string value and
# you need to convert it so you can use the value as a number.

# <Your code here>
score = int(input('Please type your score: '))
if score >= 50:
    print('pass, "Congratulation"')
elif score <=50:
    print('Fail, Keep going practice')
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3: Scholarship Eligibility
# Your university offers scholarships based on academic performance.
# Write a program that takes a student's GPA as input. If the GPA
# is greater than or equal to 3.5, print
# "Congratulations, you're eligible for a scholarship!". If it's
# between 3.0 and 3.49, print "You're on the waiting list."
# Otherwise, print "Keep up the good work."
# Do not forget that the input() function returns a string value and
# you need to convert it so you can use the value as a number.
# The function int() converts the number to an integer, and the function
# float() converts the number to a float.
# <Your code here>
gpa = float(input("Enter your GPA: "))
if gpa >= 3.5:
    print('Congratulations, you are eligible for a scholarship!')
elif 3.0 <= gpa and gpa <= 3.49:
    print('You are on the waiting list.')
else:
    print('Keep up the good work.')
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4: Shopping Discount
# A store is offering a discount on a product. Write a program that
# takes the original price and the discount percentage as input.
# If the discounted price is less than $50, print "Great deal!".
# Otherwise, print "Might want to wait for a better offer."

# <Your code here>
original_price = float(input("Enter product original price: "))
discount_percentage = float(input("Enter discount percentage: "))
discounted_price =  (original_price * discount_percentage) / 100
if discounted_price <= 50:
    print('Great deal!')
else:
    print("Might want to wait for a better offer.")
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 5: Movie Night Decision
# You and your friends are deciding on a movie to watch. Write a
# program that takes two movie ratings as input. If both ratings
# are above 7, print "Let's watch both!". Otherwise,
# print "Let's just pick one."
friend_rating_1 = int(input('Please rate the movie Spyder Man'))
friend_rating_2 = int(input('Please rate the movie Hulk'))
if friend_rating_1 == 7 and friend_rating_2 == 7:
    print("Let's watch both!")
else:
    print("Let's just pick one.")
# <Your code here>

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 6: Restaurant Recommendation
# You're building a restaurant recommendation system. Write a program
# that takes a person's mood (happy or sad) and hunger level
# (high or low) as input. If they're happy and hungry, recommend
# a fancy restaurant. If they're sad and hungry, recommend comfort food.
# For other cases, recommend a casual dining place.

# <Your code here>###
mood_level = int(input('Please rate your mood between happy 5  and sad 1'))
hunger_level = int(input('Please rate your hunger level between high  - number 5 and low number 1'))
if mood_level == 5 and hunger_level == 5:
    print('We recommend a casual dining place')
elif mood_level >= 2 and hunger_level >= 2:
    print('We recommend comfort food')
else:
    print('We recommend a casual dining place')
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 7: Exercise 7: Tax Bracket Calculator
# You're building a tax calculation system. Write a program that
# takes a person's annual income as input. Use conditionals
# to determine their tax bracket based on the following rules:

# - If income is less than $40,000, tax rate is 10%.
# - If income is between $40,000 and $100,000 (inclusive), tax rate is 20%.
# - If income is greater than $100,000, tax rate is 30%.

# Remember that a tax rate of 10% can be represented as 10/100 or 0.1

# Print the calculated tax amount for the given income.
# <Your code here>
annual_income = float(input("Enter your annual income: "))
if annual_income <= 40000:
    tax_count = (annual_income / 100) * 10
    print(f'Your annual income is {tax_count} dollars and tax 10%')
elif annual_income >= 40000 and annual_income <= 100000:
    tax_count = (annual_income / 100) * 20
    print(f'Your annual income is {tax_count} dollars and tax 20%')
else:
    tax_count = (annual_income / 100) * 30
    print(f'Your annual income is {tax_count} dollars and tax 30$')

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 8: Ticket Pricing System
# You're working on a ticket booking system for an amusement park.
# Write a program that takes a person's age as input and determines
# their ticket price based on the following rules:
# - Children (ages 3 to 12): $10
# - Adults (ages 13 to 64): $20
# - Seniors (ages 65 and above): $15
# Print the calculated ticket price for the given age.

# <Your code here>
age = int(input('How old are you? '))
if age >= 3 and age <= 12:
    print(f'Your ticket price is $10')
elif age >= 12 and age < 64:
    print(f'Your ticket price is $20')
elif age <= 2:
    print('Your ticket price is $0 go with your Mom')
else:
    print(f'Your ticket price is $15')
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 9: Password Strength Checker
# Create a program that takes a password as input and checks its
# strength based on the following rules:

# If the password is less than 8 characters, print "Weak password."
# If the password is 8 to 12 characters long, print "Moderate password."
# If the password is more than 12 characters, print "Strong password

# You can use len() function to get the length of a given string.




# <Your code here>
password = input("Enter your password: ")
counter = len(str(password))
if counter >=8 and counter <=11:
    print('Moderate password.')
elif counter <8:
    print('Weak password')
else:
    print('Strong password')

# CHALLENGE (OPTIONAL): Course Enrollment Eligibility
# To solve this exercise, you will need to use the following concepts
# and methods:
# - String method .upper()
# - String slicing
# - if-elif-else conditional statements
#
# You're designing a course enrollment system. Write a program that
# takes a course code and a student's grade as input and determines
# whether the student is eligible to enroll in the course.

# 1. Ask the user to enter a course code (e.g., "CS101", "MATH202", ).
#    All courses ends with "101", "202" or "303". Slice the string
#    to get the last three character of the string to get the course
#    ending:
#
#    Hint:
#    test = "ABCDEF"  # Given this string
#    print(test[-2:])  # It will print "EF"

# 2. Ask the user to enter their grade (e.g., "A", "B", "C", "D", "F").
#    Use .upper() method to convert the course code and grade to uppercase,
#    allowing for case-insensitive input.
#
# Implement the following enrollment rules:
# - For courses with course codes ending in "101", students with
#   grades "A" or "B" are eligible.
# - For courses with course codes ending in "202", students with
#   grades "B" or "C" are eligible.
# - For courses with course codes ending in "303", students with
#   grades "C" or "D" are eligible.

# Print either "You are eligible to enroll." or "You are not eligible to enroll."
course_code = input("Enter the course code: ")
student_grade = input("Enter your grade: ")

# Convert input to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison
course_code = course_code.upper()
student_grade = student_grade.upper()

# Extract the last three characters of the course code (use string slicing)
course_suffix =  # your code here

# Check course code and grade to determine eligibility
if course_suffix == "101":
    ...  # <Your code here>
elif course_suffix == "202":
    ...  # <Your code here>
# <Your code here>
# Print either "You are eligible to enroll." or "You are not eligible to enroll."
# Print either "You are eligible to enroll." or "You are not eligible to enroll."
course_code = input("Enter the course code: ")
student_grade = input("Enter your the following grade:  A, B, C, D, F: ")
student_grade_q = course_code.upper()[-3:]
grade_suffix = student_grade.upper()
if student_grade_q == 101 and grade_suffix == "A" or grade_suffix == "B":
    print('You are eligible to enroll.')
elif student_grade_q == 202 and grade_suffix == "B" or grade_suffix == "C":
    print('You are eligible to enroll.')
elif student_grade_q == 303 and grade_suffix == "C" or grade_suffix == "D":
    print('You are eligible to enroll.')
